## Time spending

It is a side project that I only spent time outside of the office hours to work on. One day, my team and I were fire fighting on PROD until 11 PM. After taking a shower, I continue with Angular Jira clone for another two hours...

According to waka time report, I have spent about 45 hours working on this project. Which is equivalent to watch the [whole Stranger Things series twice][stranger].

I really enjoyed working on this project. The interactive kanban board took me sometimes, it is challenging but exciting at the same time.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project. I might do it for the proper backend GraphQL API.

## Compatibility

It was being tested on IE 11, Chrome and Firefox. For Safari, there are some minor alignment issues.
